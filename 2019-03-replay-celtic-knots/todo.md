## Overarching Plan

- get things basically connected
- do it in numpy
- do it in tensorflow

## Basic Aspects of the Algorithm

- assign a random set of numbers
- assign each tile a color index
- calculate the histogram of sizes of each color index
- assign a color to each color index
- assign a color score to the diagram

## Scoring Step 1: Go through the array, combining indices

-

## Scoring Step 2: Go through the indices and assign them colors based on the
## image.

-

## Scoring Step 2: Score the two images based on color difference.

## Next Steps

- Setup simulated annealing.
- Add in a term to minimize the number of things.
- Speed up the coloring algorithm
- Fill out the rest of this thing.
